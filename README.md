Implement a sample machine learning program for a problem statement of your choice.
---
Here's an example of a machine learning program that uses logistic regression to solve a binary classification problem of predicting whether a customer will make a purchase or not, based on their demographic and purchase history data.
---
First, the necessary libraries are imported. Then, the dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is instantiated and trained on the training data. 
---
The accuracy of the model is evaluated by making predictions on the testing data. Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on new data. Depending on the problem and available data, other machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks could also be used.
